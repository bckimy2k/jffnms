README file for JFFNMS
======================

This file contains important information about JFFNMS and should be read
before installing or upgrading JFFNMS.

Upgrading from 0.8.4
--------------------
JFFNMS version 0.8.4 shipped with a serious bug with the database extraction.
The part of the build process that makes the databases differences was 
missing, however the database dump worked ok.

This gives us two scenarios:
  * You had a pre 0.8.4 (eg 0.8.3) JFFNMS and upgraded, giving you an
    unchanged 0.8.3 database.
  * You (re)installed jffnms 0.8.4 and used the database dump. You got the 
    correct database.

The schema for 0.8.4 and 0.8.5 are the same.

This means if you are the first pre-0.8.4 scenario you WILL need to run the SQL update scripts to update your schema, just like you normally should do.

If JFFNMS 0.8.4 was your first database install, your schema is already 
current, do NOT update the database (it will error out anyhow).
