-	while keeping the load down. It will launch a fixed number of threads and send them work.
-	Requested by: Travis Johnson <tlj |a|t| ida |d|o|t| net>
-    
-    - New Poller using the new launcher.  (poller2.php)
-	Its simpler than the old poller (which is kept for some features like DMII and Satellite that are 
-	not implemented here). This is still experimental and only works in Unix.
-	
-    - Network Autodiscovery.
-	Allows you to add 1 or more seed networks and snmp communities to a zone, and when the daemon runs,
-	it will discover the devices in that network and in attached networks. This is very useful to add
-	a lot of hosts easily. Experimental Too.
-
-    - Support for SNMPv2 and SNMPv3, Including 64 bits counters.
-	For SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 we are using the integrated PHP functions and for SNMPv2 we are calling the
-	net-snmp executables (snmpget, snmpwalk and snmpset) that is a little slow, but it works.
-	When using SNMPv2 or v3, the 64 bit OIDs will be used automatically for input and output, 
-	bytes and packet coutners.
-	Requested by: A lot of people
-
-    - New Backend Configuration Format, uses one defaults file (conf/jffnms.conf.defaults) and
-	one user-config file (conf/jffnms.conf) for easier automated upgrades.
-	JFFNMS should automatically upgrade from the old config system (conf/config.ini) to the new format.
-	Requested by: Craig Small <csmall |a|t| enc |d|o|t| com |d|o|t| au>

-	This is configured per-interfaces and allows you to specify the Nth percentil you want.
-	A New line will be shown in the traffic graph.
-	Requested by: Richard Sears <rsears |a|t| adnc |d|o|t| com> and Paul Matuszewski <paul@inofficenetworks |d|o|t| com>
-
-    - Alteon AD3 monitoring

-	Also includes Min/Max limit alerting.
-	Requested by: Daniel Afonso <dafonso |a|t| afonsoconsulting |d|o|t| com>
-
-    - New Interfaces Autodiscovery using the new launcher, replaced the old autodiscovery under the same name, all features re-implemented.
-
-    - Managed RRDtool: one RRDtool process is called by each poller and we use the open connection to multiple operations,
-	reducing the fork load. Only works on Unix.
-
-    - New Host fields: Creation, Modification, Last Poll Date and Last Poll duration Time, useful for debugging.
-
-    - Cisco PIX syslog events matching and filtering.

-JFFNMS 0.7.5 Released 2003-12-16
-================================
-
-*New Features:
-
-    - Per Interface-Type Fields:
-	
-	Until now every interface had the same fields, for some interface types this was ok, but others required more or different fields,
-	so this new feature allows different fields per interface type. 
-	    ie: Linux TC now has Rate and Ceil fields, and its not using the BW in/out fields, TCP Ports don't have IP address or BW, etc.
-	
-	This was one of the big "barriers" in the internal design of JFFNMS, so I'm glad I finally made it configurable/modular.
-    
-	- DB: 3 new tables: interface_types_fields, interface_types_field_types, and interface_values
-	- GUI: Manual Discovery has a new layout and includes all the specific interface fields.
-	- GUI: View Interfaces shows all the 'description' fields and has a better text layout
-	- API: interfaces_update updates every interface value not just the interfaces table.
-	- API: Events Text now can include any interface type specific fields
-	- API: Poller Parameters can include any interface type specific fields
-
-	- AD Tracked Fields are set from the Interface Type Fields.
-	- SLA: now you can use SLA expressions with the name of each interface type specific field
-
-	- Changed all discovery, poller and backend scripts to use the new and specific fields, ie:
-	    
-	    - ALL: changed 'descr' fields to 'description' 
-	    - Physical: Pings to Send configurable per interface
-	    - BGP: Separated field for Local IP , Remote IP and ASN values.
-	    - Applications: Number of Instanses stored in DB.
-	    - Linux TC: Specific Ceil and Rate fields. 
-    	    - Storage: Specific Size Field (it was bandwidth before)
-	    - TCP: Check content option now allows for a specific URL to be included
-	    - Reachability: Now you can configure the fping parameters per interface
-	    - Verify Interface Number Backend now uses specific Index Field.
-	    - RRD Backend gets the RRD Structure from the Interface Type Fields.
-
-	Important Notes:
-	----------------
-
-	* If you have "custom" interface types, please read the UPGRADE file carefully
-	
-	* By default we not 'track' the network interface's description via autodiscovery, so if you don't want to loose 
-	    your custom interface descriptions, please disable the field tracking via the Polling & Discovery=>Interface Types Screen. 
-

-	- Internal changes to use new rrdtool functions
-	- Time filter
-	- CSV Export
-    
-    - New API for some rrdtool functions to get dynamic structure changes,
-	this includes cleanups in all graphs and every function that uses rrdtool.
-	Now every DS goes on a different file like interface-999-0.rrd this is handled by the rrd_mode field 
-    
-    - The Interface Map Views has been broken in pieces for the cleaness of the code.
-	This also helps to add a new Map View type. (htdocs/views/*) 
-    
-    - New Interface Map View on SubMaps (dynmap) allows you to change the position of 
-	the interfaces in the map and to establish connections between them.
-    
-    - Bulk Interface Add Feature in Manual "Get Interfaces" Option, it allows you to add a lot of interfaces with only a few clicks,
-	without using autodiscovery.
-    
-    - Designated Main Interface(s) (DMII) : You can select an interface or map of interfaces which will be the Main ones for that host, this means:
-	    if the DMII are all down, the polling of that host other interfaces will stop, 
-	    except for the DMII (to detect the UP again), this solves a domino or 'stacking' problem when some hosts are unreachable. 
-	    Also, a new event is generated when the Polling Fails because of DMII being down.

-'Just For Fun' Network Management System Version 0.9.3
-	    By Javier Szyszlican and Craig Small
-======================================================
-
-Requirements:
-=============
-
--Operating System:
-    . *NIX (Development is on GNU/Linux, It has been tested on FreeBSD and Solaris too)
-    . Windows 2000/XP also works (A good crond for windows will be useful). 
-	If you are installing on Windows please read the INSTALL.win32.txt file.
-    
--Apache ( > 1.3.x or > 2.0.x)
-
--MySQL ( > 3.23.x or > 4.0.x ) or PostgreSQL ( Tested with 7.4.6 )
-
--RRDtool (www.rrdtool.org) (> 1.0.33 )
-
--PHP  ( > 5.0.x )
-	Extensions: snmp, ssl, gd, sockets, mysql or pgsql, pcre, posix, ob, pcntl and session
-
--NET-SNMP utilities and trapd server (optional) 
-
--GNU Diff 
-
--TFTP Server (optional)
-
--JFF NMS Integration Packages (TACACS+ & Syslog) (optional, useful on routers) 
-
--Graphviz & WebFonts (http://www.graphviz.org) (optional)
-
--NMAP PortScanner > 2.54B (http://www.insecure.org/nmap/) for TCP Port Discovery (optional)
-
--Fping (http://www.fping.com) for Reachability (Only on Linux/*NIX)
-
--tmpwatch (http://linux.maruhn.com/sec/tmpwatch.html) (Only on Linux/*NIX)
-	Used for deleting all temporary files
-
-
-Steps:
-======
-
-. Compile and/or Install MySQL / PgSQL
-
-. Compile and/or Install Apache
-
-. Compile and/or Install Graphviz and WebFonts (optional)
-
-. Compile and/or Install NMAP
-    
-    Nmap should be set-uid root if you want UDP port monitoring & discovery to work.
-
-    Execute: 
-        # chmod +s /usr/bin/nmap
-        # chmod a+x /usr/bin/nmap
-
-. Compile and/or Install Fping
-
-    Verify that the user running the cron jobs, is able to execute fping and that it is set-uid root.
-     
-    Execute: 
-        # chmod +s /usr/sbin/fping
-        # chmod a+x /usr/sbin/fping
-    
-    And you should see something like this:
-	-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     adm         28291 May 31 22:14 /usr/sbin/fping
-
-. Compile and/or Install RRDtool
-    
-. Compile and/or Install PHP 
-
-	I M P O R T A N T
-	-----------------
-
-    PHP Modules Needed: sockets, snmp, gd, (pgsql and/or mysql), wddx (for satellites), pcre (syslog parsing)
-
-    Be sure to add the required modules to your /etc/php.ini file.
-    
-    Remember to verify that your modules are loaded with /admin/adm/test.php or the JFFNMS setup screen.
-
-    A N D
-
-    ---------------------------------------------------
-    ---------------------------------------------------
-    Change This in your php.ini file.
-
-    register_globals = On 
-    register_argc_argv = On 
-    error_reporting  =  E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
-    allow_url_fopen = On
-    include_path = .:/usr/share/pear
-    short_open_tag = On
-    
-    ---------------------------------------------------
-    ---------------------------------------------------
-
-    Also check if your Apache is loading mod_php.
-
-    Any change to the PHP ini file (ie. /etc/php.ini) requires Apache to be restarted to take effect.
-
---------------------------------------------------------------
-. Read the docs/* files, these are examples of configuration.
---------------------------------------------------------------
-
-. Optional: Install Integration Packages tac_plus and msyslog (read the README and INSTALL files of each program).
-    Hints: 
-	-If you have problems with mysql when compiling (mysql.h lines ~245 & ~256) change DB to db (lowercase);
-	-If you have a linking problem with compress add -lz to the Makefile libraries      
-	-msyslog: Remember to change your init.d/syslog to the new binary and command line options. (read the example)
-
-. Create User & Group
-
-	Note: replace apache by your Apache user (like apache, httpd, www-data, etc)
-
-	# groupadd jffnms
-	# useradd -g jffnms -d /opt/jffnms -s /bin/false -c 'JFFNMS User' jffnms
-	# usermod -G jffnms apache
-
-. Unpack the release:
-
-	# tar xvzf jffnms-0.9.3.tar.gz 
-
-    You will get a directory called jffnms-0.9.3/ 
-
-	# mv jffnms-0.9.3 /opt/jffnms
-
-. Permissions
-	
-	# chown -R jffnms:jffnms /opt/jffnms
-	# chmod 770 /opt/jffnms
-	# chmod -R ug+rw /opt/jffnms
-
-. Crontab
-	Install the JFFNMS crontab file	
-
-	# crontab -u jffnms /opt/jffnms/docs/unix/crontab
-	
-	Now modify the values at the top if they don't match your system:
-
-	# crontab -e -u jffnms 
-
-	Allow JFFNMS to run cron jobs (AFAIK only needed in Solaris)
-
-	# echo jffnms >> /etc/cron.allow
-
-. Create the Databases
-
-    Manually create the database "jffnms", set the permissions and then import the schema and data.
-    
-    Replace the 'x' with the jffnms version number.
-    
-    MySQL:
-    ======
-	# mysql -u <mysql admin username> -p<password>
-	mysql> CREATE DATABASE jffnms;
-	mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jffnms.* TO jffnms@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'jffnms';
-	mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
-	mysql> quit
-    
-	# mysql -u jffnms -pjffnms jffnms < docs/install/jffnms-0.9.3.mysql
-    
-    PostgreSQL:
-    ===========
-	# psql template1 postgres
-	template1=# create user jffnms password 'jffnms' createdb;
-	template1=# \connect template1 jffnms
-	template1=# create database jffnms;
-	template1=# \q
-	
-	# psql jffnms jffnms < docs/install/jffnms-0.9.3.pgsql
-    
-    This will create the jffnms Tables and required records.  
-
-
-. Configure Apache as follows (from docs/*): 
-
-    1. As a Virtual Host (if you control a DNS server):
-
-	<VirtualHost *>
-            ServerAdmin you@yournet.com
-            DocumentRoot /opt/jffnms/htdocs
-            ServerName nms.yournet.com
-  	    LimitRequestLine 20000
-        </VirtualHost>
-
-    2. As a sym-link (in Unix):
-
-	ln -s /opt/jffnms/htdocs /var/www/html/jffnms 
-
-	(or the path your Apache uses).
-
-    JFFNMS needs to be at the main Document Root, a VirtualHost or a SymLink. 
-
-. Restart/Reload Apache, MySQL or PgSQL, xINETD (tftpd)
-
-. PHP Module Load Errors are reported to /var/log/httpd/error_log (RedHat) or /var/log/apache/error_log (Gentoo)
-
-. Point your browser to http://www.yourserver.com/jffnms or http://nms.yournet.com/ (depending on what you choose)
-
-	You should see the Setup screen, it should have auto-discovered your configuration.
-	Verify that everything is correct (OK, YES in green) before saving the config.
-    
-. Point your browser (again) to http://www.yourserver.com/jffnms or http://nms.yournet.com/ (depending on what you 
-choose)
-
-    Username: admin 
-    Password: admin
-
-    And now, you are inside the system.
-
-
-. You can read the manual at http://www.jffnms.org

-                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-                       Version 2, June 1991
-
- Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                            Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-    parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Program.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-    received the program in object code or executable form with such
-    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
-
-The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
-making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
-code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
-associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
-control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
-special exception, the source code distributed need not include
-anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
-form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
-operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
-itself accompanies the executable.
-
-If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
-access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
-access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
-distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
-
-  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
-parties remain in full compliance.
-
-  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
-distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
-modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
-the Program or works based on it.
-
-  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
-Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
-original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
-this License.
-
-  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
-may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
-refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
-
-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
-any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
-apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
-circumstances.
-
-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
-integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
-impose that choice.
-
-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
-be a consequence of the rest of this License.
-
-  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
-original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
-may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
-those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
-countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
-the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
-
-  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
-of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
-address new problems or concerns.
-
-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
-later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
-either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
-Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
-this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
-Foundation.
-
-  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
-programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
-to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
-Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
-make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
-of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
-of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
-
-                            NO WARRANTY
-
-  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
-FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
-OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
-PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
-OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
-MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-
-            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
-
-  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
-
-  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
-the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
-
-    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
-    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
-
-    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
-    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
-    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
-    (at your option) any later version.
-
-    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
-    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
-    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
-    GNU General Public License for more details.
-
-    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
-    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
-    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
-
-Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
-
-If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
-when it starts in an interactive mode:
-
-    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
-    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
-    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
-
-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
-parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
-
-  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
-  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
-
-  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
-  Ty Coon, President of Vice
-
-This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
-proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
-library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
-Public License instead of this License.

-README file for JFFNMS
-======================
-
-This file contains important information about JFFNMS and should be read
-before installing or upgrading JFFNMS.
-
-Upgrading from 0.8.4
---------------------
-JFFNMS version 0.8.4 shipped with a serious bug with the database extraction.
-The part of the build process that makes the databases differences was 
-missing, however the database dump worked ok.
-
-This gives us two scenarios:
-  * You had a pre 0.8.4 (eg 0.8.3) JFFNMS and upgraded, giving you an
-    unchanged 0.8.3 database.
-  * You (re)installed jffnms 0.8.4 and used the database dump. You got the 
-    correct database.
-
-The schema for 0.8.4 and 0.8.5 are the same.
-
-This means if you are the first pre-0.8.4 scenario you WILL need to run the SQL update scripts to update your schema, just like you normally should do.
-
-If JFFNMS 0.8.4 was your first database install, your schema is already 
-current, do NOT update the database (it will error out anyhow).

-This file explains the upgrade procedure between versions:
-
-0.9.2 to 0.9.3
-==============
-
-    0. You are adviced to upgrade your PHP and PostgreSQL (if you use that) versions before the upgrade,
-	because some new features may need that. 
-	
-	The new poller is still experimental, and its not enabled by default.
-
-    Replace the <patch tar.gz path> with the actual path to the patch files,
-    '../jffnms-upgrade-0.9.2-to-0.9.3' if you are using jffnms-upgrade-0.9.2-to-0.9.3.tar.gz or 
-    '/opt/jffnms-0.9.3/docs/upgrade' if you are using jffnms-0.9.3.tar.gz
-    
-    1. Apply the code patch: 
-	# cd /opt/jffnms 
-	# patch -p1 < <patch tar.gz path>/jffnms-0.9.2-to-0.9.3.patch 
-
-	If you have not changed the code, there should not be any errors.
-	Replace apache.apache with your HTTPd username and group (nobody, httpd, etc)
-
-    2. Upgrade the DB: 
-	MySQL:
-	    Backup in case of failure:
-		# mysqldump --opt -ujffnms -pjffnms jffnms > /tmp/jffnms.backup.mysql
-	
-	    Upgrade the MySQL Tables:
-		# cat docs/upgrade/mysql/jffnms-0.9.2-to-0.9.3.mysql.diff* | mysql -u jffnms -pjffnms jffnms
-
-	PgSQL:
-	    Backup in case of failure:
-		# pg_dump -U jffnms jffnms -dROc > /tmp/jffnms.backup.pgsql
-
-	    Upgrade the PgSQL Tables:
-		# cat docs/upgrade/pgsql/jffnms-0.9.2-to-0.9.3.pgsql.diff* | psql jffnms jffnms
-
-    3. Copy the new binary files: 
-
-	# cp -Rv <patch tar.gz path>/files/* /opt/jffnms/
-
-    4. Change Ownership
-    
-    	# chown -R apache:apache *
-
-	    OR if you used the new Instalation method: 
-	# chown -R jffnms:jffnms *  
-
-    
-	And then re apply the permissions to the /opt/jffnms folder:
-	
-	# chmod -R ug+rw *
-
-	
-    5. Verify Everything is ok:
-	Go to the Setup page at
-	    http://youserver/jffnms/admin/setup.php (or the path you set)
-	    
-	    Check everything, make the corrections and SAVE the Configuration anyway.

-How to do an upgrade on Windows?
---------------------------------
-
-Please read all this note before executing something, so you can understand all the process.
-
-Step 1 - Code Update:
-=====================
-
-    1. Rename the c:\jffnms folder to jffnms-old
-    2. Rename the new jffnms version folder (like c:\jffnms-0.7.3) to c:\jffnms
-    3. Copy your c:\jffnms-old\rrd folder to c:\jffnms\rrd 
-    4. Copy the c:\jffnms-old\rrdtool.exe and nmap.exe to c:\jffnms\
-    5. Re-apply the permissions, give the jffnms user FULL CONTROL over c:\jffnms
-	     
-    6. At this point you have the new version in place with your old version data. 
-	The only thing missing is a correct configuration. You have to go to your setup.php 
-	and reconfigure everything like you did when you first install it. (Step 3)
-
-
-Step 2 - Database Update:
-=========================
-
-    You have to send every file in the c:\jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql to the mysql daemon :
-    
-    1. Backup in case of failure:
-	c:\> c:\mysql\bin\mysqldump.exe --opt -u root jffnms > c:\jffnms.backup.mysql
-    
-    2. Go to the DB upgrade folder
-	c:\> cd \jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql
-
-    3. Replace OLD with your current JFFNMS version number (like 0.7.2) and NEW with the new version number (like 0.7.3)
-	c:\jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql> dir jffnms-OLD-to-NEW*	(look at all the file names)
-
-    4. Apply the DB changes
-	c:\jffnms\docs\upgrade\mysql> c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root jffnms < <Put every Filename here>
-	
-	or, as suggested by Michael Mayers:
-	
-	    If in .cmd file:
-	    for /f "tokens=*" %%i in ('dir jffnms* /b') DO c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root jffnms < %%i
-	
-	    If not in .cmd file:
-	    for /f "tokens=*" %i in ('dir jffnms* /b') DO c:\mysql\bin\mysql.exe -u root jffnms < %i
-
-
-Step 3 - Check Everything:
-==========================
-    
-    Go to your setup in http://yourserver/admin/setup.php (put the correct path here).
-    
-    Check if everything is ok, and Save the configuration.
